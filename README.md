the target of first week was to build a working signup and login page which was achieved it is working completely, currently i am not using any cloud to host my server side code so the app might not work without the backend code running on the same ip address <br/>
the next target is to use block chain to store the login information of the user instead of database <br />
the difficulty till now was to send email to the client
